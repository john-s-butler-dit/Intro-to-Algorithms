# Introduction to Algorithms with Python Code
## [John S Butler (TU Dublin)](https://johnsbutler.netlify.com/)

## Introduction
This is a first year Mathematics and Statistics module in TU Dublin which introduces the learner to basic algorithms and their implementation.  The theory and application of this subject is a cornerstone of numerical analysis, machine learning, computer science and data analytics.  The module does not assume a prior knowledge of computer science.

* This github repository contains the Python Code for the module.
  
* Some of the module lecture notes and tutorials can be found on the [website](https://sites.google.com/dit.ie/math1812/home)

1.  Introduction to Algorithms
    - Types and operations
    - Flow charts and Pseudocode
    - [Analysis of an Algorithm](https://github.com/john-s-butler-dit/Intro-to-Algorithms/blob/master/Chapter%201-%20Introduction_to_Algorithms/Simple%20Algorithms.ipynb)
2. Networks
